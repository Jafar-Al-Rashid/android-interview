# Android Interview
Template project to be given to candidates applying for Android roles at mx51.

## Welcome
Congratulations on making it to the take-home technical test. This test will help us get an understanding
of your problem solving skill and your attention to details.

This project is a basic weather app, it fetches data from an existing endpoint and displays the current temperature in celsius.

There are 3 tasks to be completed as part of this test.
1. Add a second weather endpoint, that should be used as a fail-over if the first endpoint returns an error.  
   * Endpoint #2 - WeatherStack  
   * Find the docs and a link for a free account here (https://weatherstack.com/documentation)
1. Update the UI to include a way to:-
   * Change temperature between celsius and fahrenheit  
   * Change wind speed between m/s and knots.
1. Add unit & UI tests as appropriate.

The amount of time you should allocate to this test should be no more than 6hrs.

## Submission
To submit your changes, please create a PR against this project. If successful, we'll use the work completed in this test
